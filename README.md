# Another way of matrix calculator
For some reasons I want to create a matrix calculator that can be work with a lot of stuff: 
| Stuff        | In process      | Done |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Quadratic    |           |    ✅   |
| Cubic        |           |    ✅   |
| x^n equations|           |    ✅   |
## Requirements:
- *Matrix needs to be any dimension*  ✅
- *Code must be written on* ***C/C++***     ✅✅✅
- *a lot of stuff gonna be written here down later.*

# Updates 20.09.24
- Fix a lot of stuff, all code are redesigne and rewrite;
- All functionaly are work correctly **now**
- The code is broken down into files to optimize and reduce the size of the **main.c** file
- For now, I guess... That's all stuff I implemented in this program. I can say that's a lot of work for me... There are also features that I want to screw on and implement. But at the moment, the program is completely working as I intended.

# Update 23.09.24
- Fix a lot of stuff
- Create new UI
- Will merge to C++ something stuff and develop on C++
- new function are aviable
``` thx. ```

- For compiling use:
```gcc main.c -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm```
