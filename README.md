# Another way of matrix calculator
For some reasons I want to create a matrix calculator that can be work with a lot of stuff: 
- Quadratic.
- Cubic,
- x^n equations.
- trigonometry and etc. 
## Requirements:
- *Matrix needs to be any dimension*
- *Code must be written on C/C++*
- *a lot of stuff gonna be written here down later.*
